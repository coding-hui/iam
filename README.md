## üéÅ Built-in

- User Management: Users are system operators, this function mainly completes system user configuration.

- Organization Management: Configures system organization (company, department, group).

- Resource Management: Resources are identifiers of specific resources in the business system, which can be an entity, such as a user, or a menu, button, API.

- Permission Policy: Permission policies combine multiple resources, operations, and authorization effects to provide flexible access permission management and control functions for applications.
